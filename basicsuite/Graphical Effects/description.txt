This example shows the Qt Quick 2.0 ShaderEffect type and the QtGraphicalEffect module. Qt Quick 2.0 provides the ability to use inline GLSL in your Qt Quick applications to create stunning visual effects. However, as UIs typically reuse many of the same effects, the QtGraphicalEffects module provides a set of predefined, commonly used effects. This includes blur, drop-shadows, glow, blending, opacity maskes and more.
