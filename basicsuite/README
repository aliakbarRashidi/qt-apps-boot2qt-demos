A collection of generic demos, originally created for demoing Boot2Qt
at Embedded World 2013.

The contents of this directory should be placed in /data/user/qt on a
device set up to boot the Qt launcher (b2qt-launcher and b2qt-utils
repos).

Note: The "Qt5 Launch Presentation" is by default setup to run in lofi
mode (suitable for e.g. beagleboard). For better devices, copy
main_hifi.qml to main.qml.

It is assumed that the QML Presentation System is installed.
