        text: '<p align="justify">Qt Enterprise Embedded gives you shorter time-to-market
               providing you with the productivity-enhancing tools and value-adding components.
               You are up-to-speed with development and prototyping since day one. You can just
               focus on writing your application with Qt.<br>
               <p align="justify">Qt Enterprise Embedded provides you with the following:
               <ul>
                 <li><b>A full-blown, productivity enhancing development environment</b>,
                     installed on a Linux development desktop. This self-contained environment
                     is installed and updated through one online installer and features the Qt
                     Creator Enterprise IDE, with features that facilitate the whole product
                     creation lifecycle: UI designer, code editor, direct device deployment
                     via USB or IP, emulator, on-device debugging and profiling.</li><br>
                 <li><b>Shorter time-to-market with the Boot to Qt Software Stack</b>. A
                     light-weight, Qt-optimized, full software stack that is installed into
                     the actual target device. The stack comes in two flavors, Embedded Android
                     and Embedded Linux. The pre-built stack gets you up-to-speed with prototyping
                     in no time and with our professional tooling you can customize the stack into
                     your exact production needs.</li><br>
                 <li><b>Full power and scalability of Qt on Embedded</b>. Leverage the
                     cross-platform C++ native APIs for maximum performance on both beautiful
                     user interfaces as well as non-GUI operations. With C++, you have full control
                     over your application code. You can also configure Qt Enterprise Embedded
                     directly from the source codes into a large variety of supported hardware and
                     operating systems. As with any Qt project, the same application can be deployed
                     natively to desktop and mobile OS targets as well.</li><br>
                 <li><b>Value-Adding Components</b>. No need to re-implement the wheel! Full Qt
                     Enterprise libraries give you a shortcut on development time providing ready-made
                     solutions, such as a comprehensive virtual keyboard, charts and industrial UI
                     controls.
               </ul>

               <p align="justify">Qt Enterprise Embedded includes <b>Boot to Qt</b>, a light-weight,
               Qt-optimized, full software stack for embedded systems that is installed into the actual
               target device. The Boot to Qt stack can be made to run on a variety of hardware - Qt
               Enterprise Embedded comes with pre-built images for several reference devices.
