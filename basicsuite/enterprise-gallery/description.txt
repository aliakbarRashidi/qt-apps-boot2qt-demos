The Gallery example showcases Qt Quick Enterprise Controls. If you have any suggestions for improvements to existing controls or ideas for new controls please email them to Qt.Enterprise-Controls@digia.com.

Each control can be customized and styled through the API. We have included a small subset of these customization options in the gallery example, which you can explore and interact with under the "cog" or "gear" icon on the lower right corner of each control's page.
