The Gallery example showcases Qt Quick Extras. These controls are developed based on the input and feedback coming directly from Qt for Device Creation customers.

Each control can be customized and styled through the API. We have included a small subset of these customization options in the gallery example, which you can explore and interact with under the "cog" or "gear" icon on the lower right corner of each control's page.
