This project contains quick tour of Qt 5.0, primarily focusing on its
graphical capabilities.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Requirements:

 - Qt 5, including QtDeclarative, QtGraphicalEffects and QtMultimedia.
   Commercial URL: http://qt.digia.com 
   Open Source URL: http://qt-project.org

 - The QML Presentation System: 
   URL: https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qml-presentation-system
   git: git clone https://git.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qml-presentation-system.git

 - A movie file called 'bunny.mov' in the same directory as the
   main.qml file.  The demo will run without, but the Video slide will
   not show anything.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Running:

To run the demo, start it using the Qt Quick 2.0 'qmlscene' tool. 

> qmlscene main.qml

The demo includes a slightly fancy fullscreen gradient and a rather
computationally intensive drop shadow which can be too much for
low-end GPUs. On these systems, one could try to use the 'lofi'
launcher instead.

> qmlscene main_lofi.qml

It is possible to tweak the parameters of the main file also.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Troubleshooting:

For a -developer-build of Qt, the webkit plugin and QtWebProcess will
be located inside the qtwebkit module, rather than inside QtBase, the plugin
must be added to the QML import path and the path to QtWebProcess must be
added to PATH for the demo to run.

The slides have been written for the resolution 1280x720. When resized
some of the spacing and content will look a bit odd. Any patches to 
fix this will be welcomed :)
