The demo builds libfreenect from a submodule and link to the static library version into a QtQuick plugin.

To run the demo on desktop run:

git submodule update --init
qmake && make && ./runHere.sh

To install on the device do (with the cross-compiled Qt's qmake):

git submodule update --init
~/Qt/Boot2Qt-4.x/imx6qsabresd-eLinux/qt5/bin/qmake && make && ./deploy.sh


The deploy.sh script will also take care of installing the udev rule necessary to have access to the Kinect through USB.
